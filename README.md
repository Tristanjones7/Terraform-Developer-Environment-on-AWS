# Terraform-Developer-Environment-on-AWS
This project sets up a lightweight developer environment on AWS using Terraform. The goal is to keep the build minimal and efficient, using only the core resources needed for a functional, secure development setup. Once deployed, youâ€™ll be able to connect to your EC2 instance directly from VS Code via a remote SSH session.
